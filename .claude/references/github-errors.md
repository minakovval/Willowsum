Shared by several skills (owner, 2026-11-13: rare parts moved out of the skills). Read when a GitHub call fails with 502, 503 or «token store unavailable».

**GitHub errors** (owner, 2026-11-13): on HTTP 502 or 503, or «token store unavailable», retry with backoff
(wait about 10 s, 30 s, then 90 s; at most 3 retries), then report the failure instead of looping. Before
retrying a call that is not idempotent — posting a review, a comment or an issue, opening a PR — check whether
the first attempt landed: list the PR's reviews (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/reviews`), its comments
(`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<n>/comments`), the issues (`gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?state=open&creator=<you>'`)
or the open PRs of the branch (`gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?head=<owner>:<branch>'`) and look for your text
or head SHA; post again only when it is not there. A PATCH of a PR body, adding labels and `git push` (never
`--force`) are idempotent: retry them as they are.
